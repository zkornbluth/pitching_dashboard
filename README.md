# Cy Young Pitching Dashboard

Use this to view statistics of 32 recent top pitchers.

Check it out [here](https://zkornbluth.github.io/pitching_dashboard) or on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/PitchingDashboard_17555271259050/Dashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Data Source

I obtained this data from [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball). Using the script `gather_data.py`, I collected every pitch thrown by the 32 pitchers between 2016 (the first year Statcast has complete data) and 2024.

The 32 pitchers are Cy Young Award winners Blake Snell, Chris Sale, Clayton Kershaw, Corbin Burnes, Corey Kluber, Dallas Keuchel, David Price, Félix Hernández, Gerrit Cole, Jacob deGrom, Jake Arrieta, Justin Verlander, Max Scherzer, Rick Porcello, Robbie Ray, Sandy Alcantara, Shane Bieber, Tarik Skubal, Trevor Bauer, and Zack Greinke, and runners up Adam Wainwright, Dylan Cease, Hyun Jin Ryu, Johnny Cueto, Jon Lester, Kenta Maeda, Logan Webb, Max Fried, Seth Lugo, Sonny Gray, Yu Darvish, and Zack Wheeler.

The dashboard displays the following information:
* General stats: pitches thrown, batters faced, pitches per plate appearance, strikeout rate, walk rate, and ground ball rate
* Pitch mix by year
* Most common pitch by count (balls and strikes)
* Pitch velocity by year split by pitch type

The dropdown at the bottom right of the dashboard allows you to select a pitcher.

Clicking on a pitch on any of the charts or the legend at the bottom right highlights that pitch on all charts.
